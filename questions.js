// 1. Differences between using _sessions_ or _JSON Web Tokens_ for authentication.

        //Session cookies are stored on the server memory and token are stored on the client side.

// 2. What does `bcrypt` do to help us store passwords in a secure manner.

    //Bcrypt has password hashing function, implements salting manually and automatically, and accumulative hashing rounds.

// 3. How are unit tests different from integration and end-to-end testing.

    //Unit testing isolates smaller units of software (function or methods).
    //Integration testing checks to see if different modules are working fine when combined together as a group.
    //End-to-end testing generally tests entire workflow function (whole application).

// 4. How _Test Driven Development_ changes the way we write applications and tests.

    //It helps you write higher quality code.
